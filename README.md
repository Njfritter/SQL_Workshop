## **Goal** 
For this workshop, we will focus on basic functionalities within a *MySQL* context. As well as some theory with respect to *Data Warehousing* to give context to attendee the usefulness of **SQL** data storage. 


## **Process**
This stucture will be similar to the [Python Workshop](https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup/Python_Workshop), except instead of being handed a dataset you will be handed a *database*. 

Databases:
+ [Northwind Database](https://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/)

## **Step 1: Repository**

For this step you will create a **GitHub** repository with the following requirements:
+ README detailing
	+ List of contributors
	+ Description of data set 
		+ Along with any process taken to retrieve the data set
		+ Link to the source of data set 
	+ The problem you are trying to solve (i.e. the instructions on the file for your given data set)
